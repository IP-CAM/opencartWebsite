# opencartWebsite
## Introduction 
This is an opencart website i created where I familiarized myself with opencart functionalities, mvc structure and php language.

The opencart project is configured in local with xampp. I designed and coded the layout and the pages of the website
in accordance with the requirements. There are a few sample pages available as well as a couple of sample products and 
categories.

Through this project, I have a preliminary understanding of PHP language, a more in-depth knowledge and practice
of MVC structure and its advantages, as well as opencart functionalities, template, modules, plugin for user. I have also 
gained more versatility of my css, html and jquery skills
